# SQL Intro - DB 201

## 1.0 What is SQL? (Structured English Query Language)
1. A language used for relational databases
2. Query data 

## 2.0 What is Data?
1. Facts ( words, pics)
2. Pictures
3. One of the most assets of any business
4. Needs to be secure

## 3.0 What is a Database?
1. A repository of data ( a program that stores data)
2. Provides the functionality for adding, modifing and querying that data

### 3.1 Relational Database
1. Data Stored in tabular form (column x row)

## DBMS -> Database management system and RDBMS -> Relational database management system
1. The terms database, database server, database system, data server, and database management systems are often used interchangeably.
2. RDBMS is a set of software tools that controls the data such as access, organization, and storage. And RDBMS serves as the backbone of applications in many industries including banking, transportation, health, and so on.

## 5 Basic Commands in SQL
1. Insert data to populate the table,
2. select data from the table,
3. update data in the table,
4. Delete data from the table.

### Select Statement command
After `creating a table` and `inserting data into`, we want to see the data

``` sql
SELECT * FROM FilmLocations;

SELECT Title, Director, Writer FROM FilmLocations;

SELECT Title, ReleaseYear, Locations FROM Filmlocations WHERE ReleaseYear >= 2001;
```
Others Problems

1. Problem 1

Retrieve the fun facts and filming locations of all films

```sql
SELECT Locations, FunFacts FROM FilmLocation;
```
2. Problem 2

Retrieve the names of all films released in the 20th century and before (release year before 2000 including 2000) that, along filming locations and release years.

```sql
SELECT Title, Locations, ReleaseYear FROM FilmLocations WHERE ReleaseYear <== 2000; 
```
3. Problem 3

Retrieve the names, production company, names, filming locations and release years of the films which are not written by James Cameron.

```sql
SELECT Title, ProductionsCompany, Locations, ReleaseYear FROM FilmLocations WHERE Writer <> "James Cameron"; 
```

 ### COUNT, DISTINCT, LIMIT
 1. Count -> It's a built-in database function that `retrieves` the number of rows that match the query criteria.
 
··· Example 1 -> Get the total number of rows in a given table,
 ``` sql
 select COUNT(*) from tablename
 ```
 > Shift + Option + 9 -> Interpoint 
 
 ··· Example -> Let's say you create a table called MEDALS which has a column called COUNTRY, and you want to retrieve the number of rows where the medal recipient is from Canada.
 ``` sql
 select COUNT(COUNTRY) from MEDALS where COUNTRY = "Canada; 
 
 ```
2. Distinct -> It's used to remove duplicate values from a result set.

 ··· Example -> to retrieve unique values in a column.
 ```sql
 select DISTINCT columname from Table
```
> In the MEDALS table mentioned earlier, a country may have received a gold medal multiple times.

··· Example -> retrieve the list of unique countries that received gold medals (That is, removing all duplicate values of the same country).
```sql
select DISTINCT COUNTRY from MEDALS where MEDALTYPE = 'GOLD'
```
3. Limit -> It's used for restricting the number of rows retrieved from the database.

··· Example -> Retrieve just the first 10 rows in a table.

```sql
select * from tablename LIMIT 10
```
··· Example -> Retrieve just a few rows in the MEDALS table for a particular year.

```sql 
select * from MEDALS where YEAR = 10 LIMIT 5
```
Output

| COUNTRY      | GOLD  | SILVER | BRONZE | TOTAL   | YEAR  |
| ------------ | :---: | :---:  | :----: | -----:  | :---: |
| Norway       | 18    | 14     | 11     | 39      | 2018  |
| Germany      | :---: | :---:  | :----: | -----:  | 2018  |
| USA          | :---: | :---:  | :----: | -----:  | 2018  |
| Canada       | :---: | :---:  | :----: | -----:  | 2018  |
| Brazil       | :---: | :---:  | :----: | -----:  | 2018  |


| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

OTHERS PROBLEMS

Count -
Problem 1. In this example, now we want to count the number of locations of the films. But we also want to restrict the output resultset in such a way that we only retrieve the number of locations of the films written by a certain writer.

``` sql
select count(Locations) from FilmLocations where Writer = 'James Cameron'; 
```

Problem 2. Retrieve the number of locations of the films which are directed by Woody Allen.
``` sql
select count(Locations) from FilmLocations where Director = 'Woody Allen'; 
```

Problem 3. Retrieve the number of films shot at Russian Hill.
``` sql
select count(Locations) from FilmLocations where Locations = 'Russian Hill'; 
```
Problem 4. Retrieve the number of rows having a release year older than 1950 from the "FilmLocations" table.
``` sql
select count(ReleaseYear) from FilmLocations where ReleaseYear < 1950; 
```
